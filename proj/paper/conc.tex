This work touches on the language design aspects of PPLs
in general. We also discussed the applicability of such PPLs
to a specific game (Dominion). On the latter, future work
will involve:

\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation of more Dominion-specific heuristics.
\item Designing heuristics capable of maintaining probabilistic models
      corresponding to belief states. What is the feasability of recursive
      probabilistic models in existing PPLs?
\item Cross-validation with currently held beliefs of human Dominion
      players / domain experts. \ref{human-card-comparisons}
\item Applying Machine Learning algorithms to publicly available Dominion
      data sets. \ref{dominion-data-sets}
\end{itemize}

On the PPL design side, we would like to further explore:

\begin{itemize}
\item Useability of Church, Figaro, probability monad, and other
      PPLs in the context of this work.
\item The utility of a domain specific language for modeling deckbuilding
      games. What do we gain from card-game specific probabilistic
      abstractions?
\end{itemize}
